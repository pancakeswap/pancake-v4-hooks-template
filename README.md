# Liquidity Pool Credit System

## Overview

The Liquidity Pool Credit System is an innovative DeFi project that aims to incentivize long-term liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges. By leveraging the Brevis ZK-Coprocessor, we've created a secure and transparent system that rewards consistent liquidity providers with credit points, which can be used for various benefits within the ecosystem.

## Features

- **Credit Point Accumulation**: Liquidity providers earn credit points based on the duration and consistency of their liquidity provision.
- **Reward Tiers**: Different levels of rewards are unlocked as users accumulate more credit points.
- **Reduced Transaction Fees**: Users can spend their credit points to enjoy lower transaction fees on the platform.
- **Early Access**: High-credit users get priority access to new liquidity pools.
- **Enhanced Governance Rights**: Credit points translate to increased voting power in platform governance decisions.
- **Secure Tracking**: Utilizes Brevis ZK-Coprocessor for transparent and tamper-proof credit point calculation and management.
